# Why diversity matters to your tech company

**1. When are diversity efforts most successful?**

when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. 

**2. Why do diverse companies perform better?**

because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

**3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
