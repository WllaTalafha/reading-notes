# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## Functional Programming Concepts

**1- What is functional programming?**

it is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of
mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**2- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

- the function that contains fixed data inside it, and it will not affect any other global variables as an example.
- we know the function is pure by :
1- it will return the same result for same argument every time.
2- it will not make any observable side effects.

**3- What are the benefits of a pure function?**

we can test the pure functions easier than impure functions.

**4- What is immutability?**

it is the fixed data that will not be able to change over the time.

**5- What is Referential transparency?**

when we have a pure function with immutable data then we will have the referential transparency.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

**1- What is a module?**

that is a component or thing(function, variable,..) that you would to use it outside his original file.

**2- What does the word ‘require’ do?**

it will import the exported module into the new file.

**3- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

we have to import it and use it by require method.

**4- What do we have to do to make a module available?**

export it firstly from its original file, then import it to the new file by require.
