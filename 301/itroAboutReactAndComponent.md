# Introduction to React and Components Component Based Architecture

---

## **1. What is a component?**

- as what I understand, the component is a thing that does a certain functionality, it can connect with other components and do a new behavior. it has been written by some people by writing codes that represent the final result that we can see them as components.

## **2. What are the charactistics of a component?**

- Reusability : we can use them in different applications, but there is some components designed for a specific task.


- Replaceable : you can replace the component with the similar one.


- Not context specific : there is no specific environment that component should work on it. (flexibility)


- Extensible : you can extend a new component from another one to build new functionality.


- Encapsulated : you can use the functionality of the component without knowing its internal process cycle.


- Independent : each component designed to have a minimal limit of dependencies of other components.

## **3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- Ease of deployment (no conflicts when updating the version to a new one).

- Reduced cost (when you use a third party component it will reduce the cost of development and maintenance).


- Ease of development (when you use a component with good code it will not affect other components in your system).


- Reusable (you can use the same component in other systems and applications).

- Modification of technical complexity.


- Reliability (when each component is reliable, then the reliability of the whole system will improve).


- System maintenance and evolution (you can edit and change the component easily without affecting the rest components in your system).


- Independent (each component designed to have a minimal limit of dependencies of other components).

# What is Props and How to Use it in React

## **1. What is props short for?**

- props stand for **properties**.

## **2. How are props used in React?**

- by defining an attribute (props) in the parent component, then we call this attribute into child component by dot notation, props.propName. in another way; we can send data from one component to another.

## **3. What is the flow of props?**

- uni-directional flow, one-way flow: from parent to child.

- I have to understand the meaning of Component-Based Architecture again.
