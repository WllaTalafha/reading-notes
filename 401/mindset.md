# Mindset

Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better.
To upgrade your hard technical skills , you'll need to apply deliberate practice.
the software you build really must pushes you outside your comfort zone.
You have to force yourself to learn, try,and dig deep to solve the problems you face.
That's where deliberate practice comes in. 

What is deliberate practice ?
Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

1- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone.

2- Repeated often.

3- Feedback on results in continuously available.

4- It's highly demanding mentally.

5- It's difficult.

6- It requires good goals.

The only person who understands your skillset well enough to teach you is you. 
The challenges have to push you just outside your comfort zone.
Whatever challenges you settle on, they need to be repeated often. 
Much of the benefit of learning a new technique or skill is the ability to apply it in novel situations.
You know you've upgraded your skills if you're mentally exhausted after a technical challenge.
It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what you learned on the way.

#### As what  Carol Dweck said 
Carol Dweck researches “growth mindset” — the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. she described two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet? A great introduction to this influential field. <br>

### Grit: The power of passion and perseverance
Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled. Here, she explains her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success.

### A kinder, gentler philosophy of success
Alain de Botton examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments. Is success always earned? Is failure? He makes an eloquent, witty case to move beyond snobbery to find true pleasure in our work.
