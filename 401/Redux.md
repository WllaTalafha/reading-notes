Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, 
Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse. 
So it’s is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

A lot of developers love Redux is the developer experience that comes with it. A lot of other tools have begun to do similar things, but big credits to Redux.
Some of the nice things you get with using Redux include logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay — all without doing so much on your end as the developer. These things will likely sound fancy until you use them and see for yourself.
The Redux Store can be likened to the Bank Vault. It holds the state of your application — and keeps it safe.
