## What is command line ?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### What is Shell 
This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands.
##### Notes :
> There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell

> We can use  < echo $SHELL >

## Basic Navigation!
<pre>
pwd //Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

explorer.exe .  // it opens the current directory (GUI)

mkdir // make directory (create a directory (folder))

mkdir <the name of the folder>

cd <name of folder> // open the folder with that name

cd .. // go back

rmdir // remove a folder

mkdir folder1 folder2 // creates two folders

mkdir "folder1 folder2"// creates a folder (one folder only)

ls // list, to see a folder contents.

clear // to clear the CLI (or use CTRL + L)

touch file.txt // creates a txt file with the name file

cat file.txt // checks the contents of the file itself.

nano file.txt // opens the file to edit it.

date // shows the current date.

curl wttr.in/amman // shows the weather

rm -rf <file/folder name> // removes an unempty file.

  ** // after the dash (-) command is called "flag" \\ ** </pre>
