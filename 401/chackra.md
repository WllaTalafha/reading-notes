# Chakra UI

Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications. 
It is built on top of styled-system, a utility library that allows you to style your components quickly and easily.

**Chakra UI is best known for having:**

- fewer classes for each HTML tag.
- easy manual manipulation in CSS classes.
- a robust, layout-focused library.
- easier-to-pick-up controls (since it's new).
- composable, flexible, and scalable code.
- built-in support (fewer code changes).
- good documentation.
- a level of performance that is good for small- to medium-sized, uniquely designed apps.

**Material UI is best known for having:**

- a large variety of pre-styled UI components.
- more classes for individual HTML tags.
- more CSS classes with more components.
- less facility for the creation of custom components.
- robust documentation (slightly better than Chakra UI).
- a more mature and active community.
- a level of performance that is great for large, data-driven apps.

If you need something that’s quick on its feet, Chakra UI is the best option, since it is super easy to learn and lightweight.

If custom designs are important for your project, Chakra’s developer convenience is the more attractive option.

Material UI has many more ready-to-use UI components, so we recommend going with it for websites and apps where a unique design is not central to the app,
for larger websites, and for apps that require extremely good performance and reliability.
