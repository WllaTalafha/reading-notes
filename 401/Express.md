# Review, Research, and Discussion

- What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?
PUT overwrites the entire entity if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it doesn’t exist.
Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource. This means that you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won’t affect or change anything else

- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like json-server

1- [Postman Mock Server](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/mock-servers/setting-up-mock/)  
2- [reqres](https://reqres.in/)  
3- [mocki.io](https://mocki.io/fake-json-api)

- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?  

```text
apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code.
It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page;  
Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease.
It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation. 
```

- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

```text
1) SOAP
- Communication happens using XML only
- Request is sent to SOAP methods
- Documentation is in WSDL (Wizdal)
- Heavy, more secure, more stable
- getting less popular
2) REST API
- Communication happens using Json, XML
- Requests are sent to API methods/urls using
- Communication happens in HTTP(Internet)
- Lightweight, stable
- Easy to develop and automate
- very popular
```
